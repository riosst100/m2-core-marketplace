Hi,

<p>Sorry for bothering you. We are now testing our coupon code generation tool and are happy to have all the customer feedback we can get.</p>
<p>Please come back to us if any questions.</p>

<p>By the way, to compensate your time we would like to offer a <strong>{{var discount_amount_formatted|raw}}</strong> discount on any products at the store. Don't hesitate to use it!

Best Regard!
<p>Your coupon code is <strong>{{var coupon_code|raw}}</strong>.
    The coupon will give you <strong>{{var discount_amount_formatted|raw}}</strong> discount. </p>
